    -2. Attaining this qualification will not only open doors within the Software Engineering environment but will also indicate my ability to maintain consistent punctuality, professionalism and attendance, 
        perseverance with subject matter that is difficult to understand and master, as well as diligence and commoitment to a high standard.

3. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

   2. To Become partner with like minded people and start a copany that develops community oriented applications even when I am employed

    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.
   1. Being a good communicator means I will be able to build networks successfully if I am exposed to people who are in the field I choose.
      Because I am a good teamworker and am able to facilitate, I believe I will be able to build and be efficient in a team. I am able to lead and also take direction and constructive criticism when necessary.         This will allow me to seek opportunities to learn and improve my skills while also understanding the culture in this industry. 

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
   1. Practice what I learn with personal projects that will make sure i do not struggle when I have to do the portfolio.
   2. Consistently act fast on feedback I recieve from my coach on areas that need improvement so that I can build a habit of not letting bad performance become a norm, continue to arrive punctually and daily on        campus and adhere to the culture.  Put all my effort into the successful completion of this course.
   3. In order to find employment i would need to make sure I not only get good marks and network but also maintain personal attributes such as professionalism, reliability and the ability to act on feedback            without delay.
    - Include any resources or support required.
      I am already provided with sufficient support in the form of a facilitator, a coach laptop and a router.  My honest assessment is that I need to optimise my use of the support already provided to me.
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
     1. I will need to either build a proffessional social network presence or adjust my existing accounts from being personal to being professional so that they are more attractive to people or companies that    
        recruit online.
     2. Join social network communities and attend events that have people in my field of interest so that i can be exposed to them and have the ability to brainstorm ideas with likeminded people.  Getting to 
        know some of my classmates better will also help me to meet people who might be right under my nose that share the same ideas that I do.
     3. I will need to perform well enough at any employer for me and any business I am associated with to have a good professional reputation.  I will also need to sell myself to prospective employers.
    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.
     1. I will need a qualification in Python and Jave, these will allow me to make apps that work offline and also program things such as robots.
     2. It would be a good idea for me to do some volunteer work while i wait for employment so that i can have references that have seen my work, learnerships will also help get me ready for a permanent role.
      
### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
      1. The only challenge that is not completely in my hands will be the time it will take for me to find employment.  I feel i have performed to the best of my ability but believe it is because I have not been          in a challenging academic environment such as this one in almost 15 years. in this six weeks I have adjusted enough to be know what to expect in the next part of the course and be ready.
    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.
     1. By passing the course well and having an appealing portfolio I believe I can implrove my chances of finding employment quickly.
     2. The best way to improve my performance is to work harder and take feedback from my coach. I have set aside two hours each evening and an hour each morning to catch up on concepts I struggled with and have         extra time in which to complete projects.
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
   1. I can use the Community Friday meetings and other Code Space events to learn as much as I can about the industry and what opportunities are in it.  These can also help me to network
   2. looking for free online courese that will equip me with in demand skills and certifications.
   3. Volunteering to offer my services to businesses or the community in order to build a portfolio
   4. Joining social media sites and communities
